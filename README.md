## ✨ About The Project

**SimplyPDF** is a premium, high-performance web application designed to redefine how you interact with PDFs. Built with a hyper-polished, responsive aesthetic, it offers a seamless, desktop-class experience for editing, converting, and managing documents directly in your browser.

### Key Features

- ⚡ **Client-Side Processing**: Zero server uploads. All magic happens locally in your browser for 100% privacy.
- 💎 **Premium Design**: A stunning, responsive UI built with **Tailwind CSS 4**, featuring glassmorphism, micro-interactions, and fluid animations.
- 📝 **Advanced Editor**: Full suite of professional tools—add text, signatures, shapes, and images with ease.
- 🛠️ **16+ Powerful Tools**: Merge, Split, Compress, Convert (Word/Excel/JPG), Organize, Watermark, and more.
- 🔒 **Enterprise Grade**: Secure by design with no data retention.
